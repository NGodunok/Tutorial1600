This will be less a tutorial and more of a discussion of what you can do in a js file. To begin, you need to name your file using ".js" at the end of
its name. With that file, you will be able to create handlers, effects, constants, and implement those aspects into html code which you can display by 
putting into the parenthesis following "return". 
```
return(
  <html>
  <head>
  <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>

  <h1>Hello World</h1>

  </body>
  </html>
)
```
