   - In VS (visual studio) download the extention "Live Server" authored by Ritwick Dey.
   - Download any other extentions you think will be helpful (there are plenty of online resources discussing VS extentions)
2. Now open or create a folder in which you want to have your code
   - You can minimize the VS window and right click on your desktop to create a folder.
   - To open a folder simply press the "Open Folder" button when VS first boots up, or in the top left press "File", and again "Open Folder".
